Compilers Projects
------------------

These are the current projects for my compilers class

*	Project 0: A Calculator From Scratch
	> The goals of this project are to learn how to write a simple scanner
	> and parser from scratch, to dispel the magic around parsing and
	> scanning, and to develop a simple functioning calculator that, in
	> addition to performing basic arithmetic operations, allows for data
	> to be loaded from and stored to arbitrary memory addresses

*	Project 1: [Coming Soon]
